# HTTP transports

Enkaku provides two different packages to be used by the client and server for HTTP communications.

## Client transport

The [`@enkaku/http-client-transport` package](../api/http-client-transport/index.md) provides a transport over HTTP using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and if needed an [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) for stateful interactions.

## Server transport

The [`@enkaku/http-server-transport` package](../api/http-server-transport/index.md) provides a transport serving HTTP requests and forwarding them to the attached Enkaku server.

The HTTP server transport provides a [`fetch` method](../api/http-server-transport/index.md#fetch) compliant with the [WinterCG Fetch specification](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), which is supported by various JS runtimes.

The following example shows how to use it in Deno:

```ts
import { ServerTransport } from 'https://esm.sh/@enkaku/http-server-transport'
import { serve } from 'https://esm.sh/@enkaku/server'

const transport = new ServerTransport()
serve({
  handlers: {
    'example:request': () => {
      return { test: true }
    },
  },
  public: true,
  // The transport must be passed to the Enkaku server
  transport,
})

// The transport can be used as default export, Deno using its `fetch` method
export default transport
```

Using the server transport in Val Town is similar, only exposing the `fetch` method as default export, as [presented in this example](https://www.val.town/v/paul_lecam/EnkakuServerExample).

### Usage with NodeJS

NodeJS needs an adapter such as [Hono's node server](https://github.com/honojs/node-server) to adapt the requests and responses:

```ts
import { ServerTransport } from '@enkaku/http-server-transport'
import { serve } from '@enkaku/server'
import { serve as serveHTTP } from '@hono/node-server'

const transport = new ServerTransport()
serve({
  handlers: {
    'example:request': () => {
      return { test: true }
    },
  },
  public: true,
  // The transport must be passed to the Enkaku server
  transport,
})

// Provide the transport's `fetch` method as a handler for Hono's adapter
const httpServer = serveHTTP({ fetch: transport.fetch })
```
