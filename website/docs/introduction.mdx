# Discover Enkaku

Enkaku is a framework for defining, validating, authenticating, and executing procedures between clients and servers over any transport you need.

## Procedure types for any case

Enaku supports four types of procedures to interact between a client and server: stateless [events](./procedures.mdx#events) and [requests](./procedures.mdx#requests), as well as stateful [streams](./procedures.mdx#streams) and bidirectional [channels](./procedures.mdx#channels).

## Validate and authenticate as needed

Enkaku uses [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) to define and validate the messages exchanged between the client and server.

All messages are structured as [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) objects that can be signed to ensure the integrity of the messages and authenticate the sender.

## Run your clients and servers anywhere JS goes

HTTP is great but there are so many other places where client-server interactions are relevant in JS applications, such as [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), [Node child proceses](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html), [Electron processes](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc) and many others.

Enkaku provides a simple transport interface based on [Web Streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) to support a wide range of communication APIs.
