# Stateless HTTP server

The following example presents a simple stateless HTTP server, only handling events and requests:

```ts
import { ServerTransport } from "https://esm.sh/@enkaku/http-server-transport";
import { serve } from "https://esm.sh/@enkaku/server";

const transport = new ServerTransport();

serve({
  public: true,
  transport,
  handlers: {
    "example:event": (ctx) => {
      console.log("received event:", ctx.data);
    },
    "example:request": () => {
      console.log("received request");
      return { test: true };
    },
  },
});

export default transport;
```

This example is made for Deno and similar runtimes. For more information about how to use the HTTP transport in various runtimes, [read the dedicated guide](../guides/http-transports.mdx#server-transport).
