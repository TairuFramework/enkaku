# Authenticated HTTP API

The following example presents how to use Enkaku's built-in access control to create a simple API interating with a database.

## API server

The main requirements to enable access control are to provide the server `id` matching the server signer and the `access` record to grant or deny access to specific procedures. The `*` character can be used as wildcard matching any procedure.

The signer specified by the `id` always has access to the API, so even procedures not listed in the `access` record or having restricted access are accessible to it.

The [full example code is available on Val Town](https://www.val.town/v/paul_lecam/EnkakuAuthenticatedAPI), using its SQLite implementation to store data. The following code presents the main parameters to use for the server:

```ts
// ... previous code omitted for brevity

serve({
  // The server ID needs to be specified to check access control
  id: Deno.env.get("ENKAKU_SERVER_ID")!,
  access: {
    // Deny access to all signers other than the one matching the server ID
    "*": false,
    // Allow access to the following endpoint using any signer
    "kv:get": true,
    "kv:set": true,
  },
  transport,
  handlers: {
    "kv:get": async (ctx) => {
      const value = await getValue(ctx.message.payload.iss);
      console.log("get value", ctx.message.payload.iss, value);
      return value;
    },
    "kv:list": async () => {
      return await listEntries();
    },
    "kv:set": async (ctx) => {
      console.log("set value", ctx.message.payload.iss, ctx.param);
      await setValue(ctx.message.payload.iss, ctx.param);
    },
  },
});
```

## Public client

A public client can interact with the `kv:get` and `kv:set` procedures, only accessing the data associated to its own signer.

The [full example code is available on Val Town](https://www.val.town/v/paul_lecam/EnkakuAuthenticatedAPIClient).

## Admin client

An "admin" client uses the server's private key to sign messages. It allows the client to execute any procedure made available by the server, independently of access control settings.
