# Security

A server can be configured to either be public or restricted to only allow signed requests.

Additional access control configuration can be provided to grant or restrict access to specific procedures.

## Public access

By allowing public access, a server can accept either signed or unsigned messages from clients. Any restriction needs to be implemented in the procedure handlers.

To enable public access, simply set the `public` parameter to `true` when creating a server, for example:

```ts
import { serve } from '@enkaku/server'

serve({
  // ...
  public: true,
})
```

:::warning

Setting this option will disable **all** access control checks and allow any client to access all procedures exposed by the server.

If the `access` option is provided, it will be ignored.

:::

## Restricted access

The simplest way to restric access to a server is to set the `id` parameter to a signer ID in the server parameters. Doing so will ensure only messages signed by the given signer are accepted by the server.

Clients also need to provide the server ID as the `serverID` parameter, as well as the client's `signer` to ensure messages sent by the client are signed for the expected server.

The following example presents a simple setup for a server and a client using the same signer:

```ts title="signer.js"
import { randomTokenSigner } from '@enkaku/token'

export const signer = randomTokenSigner()
```

```ts title="server.js"
import { serve } from '@enkaku/server'

import { signer } from './signer.js'

serve({
  // ...
  id: signer.id,
})
```

```ts title="client.js"
import { Client } from '@enkaku/client'

import { signer } from './signer.js'

const client = new Client({
  // ...
  signer, // use the same signer as the server
  serverID: signer.id, // the server ID must be provided, here it is the signer ID
})
```

You can learn more about managing signers in the [following guide dedicated to key management](./guides/key-management.mdx).

## Procedures access control

If the server is not configured as `public`, the `access` option can be used to set access control for specific procedures.

The `access` record is a mapping of procedure names to a boolean or array of strings. A value of `true` means the procedure is accessible with no further check than being a signed message, while `false` means it's not accessible to anyone but the configured server `id`. An array of strings can be used to allow access to specific signer IDs.

By default, access is restricted to only the server signer, which is equivalent to setting the `access` value to `false` for every procedure name.

```ts
import { serve } from '@enkaku/server'

import { signer } from './signer.js'

serve({
  // ...
  id: signer.id,
  access: {
    'auth/login': true, // anyone can call this procedure
    'user/list': ['did:key:123...', 'did:key:456...'], // only the specified signers (and the server signer) can call this procedure
    'user/delete': false, // only the server signer can call this procedure (default behavior)
  }
})
```

### Partial matches

The `access` record supports partial matching of procedure names, using the `/` character to separate parts and the `*` character to represent a partial match.

:::caution

The `*` character should only be used as the last character in a partial match, such as `users/*`. It is not supported as a wildcard character in the middle of a partial match, such as `users/*/delete`, as the access control checks will grant access using the first `*` match found, without checking if there are more specific matches.

```ts
// ❌ This example presents an invalid access control configuration.
const invalid = {
  'admin:*': false, // this represents an exact match for the procedure name "admin:*", not all procedures that start with "admin:"
  'user/test-*': true, // this represents an exact match for the procedure name "user/test-*", not all procedures that start with "user/test-*"
  'user/*/delete': false, // this represents a match for all the procedure names starting with "user/*", not all procedures that start with "user/*" and end with "/delete"
}

// ✅ This example presents a valid access control configuration.
const valid = {
  '*': false, // matches all procedures
  'myapp:auth/*': true, // matches any procedure under the "myapp:auth" namespace
  'myapp:admin/products/*': ['did:key:123...', 'did:key:456...'], // matches a restricted set of procedures
}
```
